4)Description of project:

"The AutoTest & DocGen Manager is an intelligent web-based system designed 
 to help software developers manage projects and analyze source code in an  
 automated and structured way.The system allows users to sign up and sign in, create and manage projects,  
 and analyze source code by pasting code or uploading code files with the  
 ability to select the programming language. Through static code analysis, the  
 system extracts the code structure, generates UML class diagrams, and  
 provides high-level and low-level logical explanations of the code. All  generated documentation, including diagrams and explanations, can be  
 exported in PDF or Markdown formats. Additionally, the system includes a  
 notification mechanism to inform users about important project and analysis  
 events. The main objective of the project is to simplify code understanding,  
 automate technical documentation, and support developers in organizing and  
 documenting their software projects efficiently."
